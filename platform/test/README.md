# 🚀 EKS Platform Infrastructure

This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying a secure and scalable EKS platform with integrated security features.

## 🧭 Architecture Overview

The infrastructure includes:

- ☸️ EKS Cluster with managed node groups
- 🎯 ALB Ingress Controller for load balancing
- 🛡️ WAF protection for the ALB
- 🌐 Route53 for DNS management
- 🔒 ACM for SSL/TLS certificates
- 🤖 ArgoCD for GitOps deployments
- 📛 External DNS for automatic DNS management

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- 🧑‍💻 AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- 🌍 Terraform >= 1.10
- 🐳 kubectl
- 🎩 helm
- 🔐 AWS IAM role with necessary permissions
- 📦 S3 bucket for Terraform state

## 🔐 Required AWS Permissions

The IAM role should have permissions for:

- ☸️ EKS cluster management
- 🌐 VPC and networking
- 🪪 IAM role and policy management
- 🛡️ WAF and Shield
- 📛 Route53
- 🔒 ACM
- 📦 S3
- 📊 CloudWatch

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components

### 🌐 Network Layer
- 🕸️ VPC with public and private subnets
- 🔐 Security groups for ALB and EKS
- 🌉 NAT Gateways for private subnet internet access

### ☸️ EKS Cluster
- 👥 Managed node groups
- 🎯 ALB Ingress Controller
- 🤖 ArgoCD for GitOps
- 📛 External DNS

### 🛡️ Security
- 🧱 WAF protection for ALB
- 🔐 Security groups with least privilege
- 🔒 HTTPS enforcement
- 📊 CloudWatch monitoring and alerts

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 🧾 Environment Variables
Create a `test.tfvars` file with your configuration:

```hcl
env    = "test"
region = "eu-west-1"

# VPC Configuration
vpc_cidr             = "10.0.0.0/16"
vpc_name             = "eks-test-vpc"
private_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
public_subnet_cidrs  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

# EKS Configuration
cluster_name    = "platform-test-eks"
cluster_version = "1.33"

# WAF Configuration
waf_name        = "platform-test-eks-alb-protection"
waf_description = "WAF protection for EKS ALB Ingress"
```

### 🧱 WAF Rules
The WAF configuration includes:

- 📦 AWS Managed Rules Common Rule Set
- 🚫 Known Bad Inputs Rule Set
- 🌍 Amazon IP Reputation List
- 🛠️ Custom rule overrides as needed

## 🚀 Deployment

1. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

2. Review the planned changes:
```bash
terraform plan -var-file=test.tfvars
```

3. Apply the configuration:
```bash
terraform apply -var-file=test.tfvars
```

## 📈 Monitoring and Alerts

- 📊 CloudWatch metrics for WAF
- 📢 SNS topics for security alerts
- 🚫 Blocked requests monitoring
- ⚙️ Custom metrics for specific rules

## 🔐 Security Features

### 1. Network Security:
- 🕸️ Private subnets for EKS nodes
- 🔐 Security groups with least privilege
- 🌉 NAT Gateways for controlled internet access

### 2. Application Security:
- 🧱 WAF protection against common web exploits
- 🔒 HTTPS enforcement
- 🚫 IP reputation filtering

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting:
- 📊 CloudWatch metrics
- 📢 SNS notifications
- 📺 Custom dashboards

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### 🔄 Updating WAF Rules
1. Modify the `waf_rules` in `test.tfvars`
2. Apply changes:
```bash
terraform apply -var-file=test.tfvars
```

### 📈 Scaling the Cluster
1. Update node group configuration in `test.tfvars`
2. Apply changes:
```bash
terraform apply -var-file=test.tfvars
```

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

### 🐞 Common Issues

#### ALB Creation:
- ✅ Ensure ALB Ingress Controller is properly installed
- 🔐 Check IAM permissions
- 🔧 Verify security group configurations

#### WAF Association:
- 🧱 Verify ALB exists before WAF creation
- ⚙️ Check WAF rule configurations
- 📊 Review CloudWatch metrics

#### DNS Issues:
- 📛 Verify Route53 configuration
- 🤖 Check External DNS addon
- 🔍 Review DNS records
